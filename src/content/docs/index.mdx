## About the project

A design system is a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be combined to build a wide range of applications.

For governments, a well-crafted design system ensures consistency, accessibility, and user-friendliness across all citizen-facing digital services.

At <a href="https://codeforpakistan.org" target="_blank">Code for Pakistan</a>, we are developing a design system that has the potential to become the standard for all digital services in Pakistan. Currently, it is used internally for building digital products for various government departments and the public. We also advocate for its adoption by technology units within the government.

Governments exist to serve their people, and a strong design system helps them do that more effectively.
